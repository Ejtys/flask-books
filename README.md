# flask-books
Learning CRUD app aim at getting familiar with Flask basic. Using database created by scraped from books.toscrape.com (see book-scraper repo)

The app is working. Although it is not perfect i learned a lot about bootstrap and flask. Web dev is starting to look doable.

The main problem with that app is that jinja2 is generating 3000 lines of html to sent id to client. It needs to create two modals for each row. There is for sure easy js solution for that but at the moment i am not learning js so I will leave it like that.
